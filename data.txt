1.A solution of N-(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-2-(pyridin-3-yl)acetamide (30 mg, 0.10 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF, 3 mL) was mixed with lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH₄, 10 mg, 0.26 mmol). The mixture was then refluxed under nitrogen atmosphere for 6 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was carefully quenched by adding water (1 mL) followed by 15% sodium hydroxide solution (1 mL) and finally, more water (5 mL). The organic phase was separated, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography to yield 2-(pyridin-3-yl)ethylamine (25 mg, 90% yield) as a pale yellow oil.
2.A solution of ((1S,2S)-1-{[(4'-methoxymethyl-biphenyl-4-yl)-(2-pyridin-2-yl-cyclopropanecarbonyl)-amino]-methyl}-2-methyl-butyl)-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (25 mg, 0.045 mmol) and dichloromethane (4 mL) was treated with a solution of HCl in dioxane (4 N, 0.5 mL) and the resulting reaction mixture was maintained at room temperature for 12 h. The reaction was then concentrated to dryness to afford (1R,2R)-2-pyridin-2-yl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ((2S,3S)-2-amino-3-methylpentyl)-(4'-methoxymethyl-biphenyl-4-yl)-amide (18 mg, 95% yield) as a white solid.
3.A mixture of benzaldehyde (15 mg, 0.14 mmol) and acetone (10 mg, 0.17 mmol) was stirred in ethanol (2 mL) and treated with sodium hydroxide (10 mg, 0.25 mmol). The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. After completion, the reaction mixture was neutralized with hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to yield dibenzylideneacetone (20 mg, 80% yield) as a yellow solid.
4.A solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (20 mg, 0.092 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of acetone (12 mg, 0.16 mmol) in methanol (3 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours, after which an orange precipitate formed. The precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold methanol to afford the corresponding hydrazone (18 mg, 85% yield) as an orange solid.
5.A solution of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (30 mg, 0.17 mmol) in dichloromethane (4 mL) was added to a stirring solution of sodium azide (20 mg, 0.31 mmol) in water (2 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours. The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted twice with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness, yielding 3-chloropropyl azide (28 mg, 92% yield) as a colorless oil.
6.A mixture of pyridine (20 mg, 0.25 mmol) and chloroacetyl chloride (15 mg, 0.13 mmol) in dichloromethane (2 mL) was stirred at 0°C under nitrogen. Triethylamine (20 µL, 0.14 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 6 hours. The mixture was then quenched with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic layer was dried and concentrated to yield N-(2-chloroacetyl)pyridinium chloride (25 mg, 88% yield) as a white solid.
